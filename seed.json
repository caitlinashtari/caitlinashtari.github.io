    "title": "Learning Playlist",
    "description": "Currently, classroom instruction is one-size fits all. Whether in a public elementary school, university lecture, or code school, students are treated as a collective rather than as individuals with different learning styles, interests, and motivations. The goal of this project is to make the learning experience differentiated through a student-teacher created “playlist” or lesson list so that each student’s individual needs are met and every student excels. Includes options for teacher created lessons, or self-directed lessons.",
